GUESSING THE NUMBER GAME
========================
The following program randomly generates an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100. The program then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the program outputs an appropriate message. Otherwise, the program checks whether the guessed number is less than the random number. If the guessed number is less than the random the number generated by the program, the program outputs the message, "Your guess is lower than the number"; otherwise, the program outputs the message, "Your guess is higher than the number". The program then prompts the user to enter another number. The user is prompted to guess the random number until the user enters the correct number.

The program uses the method random of the class Math to generate a random number. To be specific, the expression:

	Math.random()

returns a value of type double greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. To convert it to an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100, the program uses the following expression:

	(int) (Math.random() * 100);

Furthermore, the program uses the boolean variable done to control the loop. The boolean variable done is initialized to false. It is set to true when the user guesses the correct number.
