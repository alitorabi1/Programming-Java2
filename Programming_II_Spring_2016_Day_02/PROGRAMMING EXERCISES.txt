PROGRAMMING EXERCISES
=========================
1. Design a GUI program to find the weighted average of four test scores. The four test scores and their respective weights are given in the following format:
testscore1 weight1
...
For example, the sample data is as follows:
75 	0.20
95 	0.35
85 	0.15
65 	0.30

The user is supposed to enter the data and press a Calculate button. The program must display the weighted average.




2. Write a GUI program that converts seconds to years, weeks, days, hours, and minutes. For this problem, assume 1 year is 365 days.



3. Design and implement a GUI program to compare two strings and display the larger one.



4. Write a GUI program to convert a character to a corresponding integer, and vice versa.



5. Write a GUI program to convert all letters in a string to uppercase letters. For example, Alb34ert will be converted to ALB34ERT.



6. Write a GUI program to convert all lowercase letters in a string to uppercase letters, and vice versa. For example, Alb34eRt will be converted to aLB34ErT.



7. Write a GUI program to compute the amount of a certificate of deposit on maturity. The sample data follows:

Amount deposited: 80000.00
Years: 15
Interest rate: 7.75

Hint: To solve this problem, compute 80000.00 (1 + 7.75 / 100)15.



8. Write a GUI program that will accept three (integer) input values, say, x, y, and z, and then verify whether or not x * x + y * y = z * z.


9. Design and implement a GUI program to convert a positive number given in one base to another base. For this problem, assume that both bases are less than or equal to 10. Consider the sample data:
number = 2010, base = 3, and new base = 4.

In this case, first convert 2010 in base 3 into the equivalent number in base 10 as follows:

2 * 33 + 0 * 32 + 1 * 3 + 0 = 54 + 0 + 3 + 0 = 57

To convert 57 to base 4, you need to find the remainders obtained by dividing by 4, as shown in the following:

57 % 4 = 1, quotient = 14
14 % 4 = 2, quotient = 3
3 % 4 = 3, quotient = 0.
Therefore, 57 in base 4 is 321.
