1. Consider the following incomplete Java program:
public class 3_PrExercise1
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
	.
	.
	.
  }
}

a. Write Java statements that import the classes Scanner, FileReader, and PrintWriter from the packages java.util and java.io.

b. Write statements that declare inFile to be a reference variable of type Scanner and outFile to be a reference variable of type PrintWriter.

c. The program will read data from the file inData.txt and write output to the file outData.dat.Write statements to open both these files, associate inFile with inData.txt, and associate outFile with outData.dat.

d. Suppose that the file inData.txt contains the following data:
10.20 5.35
15.6
Randy Gill 31
18500 3.5
A


The numbers in the first line represent the length and width, respectively, of a rectangle. The number in the second line represents the radius of a circle. The third line contains the first name, last name, and the age of a person. The first number in the fourth line is the savings account balance at the beginning of the month and the second number is the interest rate per year. (Assume that p ¼ 3.1416.) The fifth line contains an uppercase letter between A and Y (inclusive). Write statements so that after the program executes, the contents of the file outData.txt are as shown below. If necessary, declare additional variables. Your statements should be general enough so that if the content of the input file changes and the program is run again (without editing and recompiling), it outputs the appropriate results.

Rectangle:
Length = 10.20, width = 5.35, area = 54.57, parameter = 31.10

Circle:
Radius = 15.60, area = 764.54, circumference = 98.02

Name: Randy Gill, age: 31
Beginning balance = $18500.00, interest rate = 3.50
Balance at the end of the month = $18553.96

The character that comes after A in the ASCII set is B

e. Write the statement that closes the output file.
f. Write a Java application program that tests the Java statements that you wrote in parts a–e.

6. Write a program that calculates and prints the monthly paycheck for an employee. The net pay is calculated after taking the following deductions:

Federal Income Tax: 	15%
State Tax: 		3.5%
Social Security Tax: 	5.75%
Medicare/Medicaid Tax: 	2.75%
Pension Plan: 		5%
Health Insurance: 	$75.00

Your program should prompt the user to input the gross amount and the employee name. The output will be stored in a file. Format your output to have two decimal places. A sample output follows:

Bill Robinson
Gross Amount: 		$ 3575.00
Federal Tax: 		$ 536.25
State Tax: 		$ 125.13
Social Security Tax: 	$ 205.56
Medicare/Medicaid Tax: 	$ 98.31
Pension Plan: 		$ 178.75
Health Insurance: 	$ 75.00
Net Pay: 		$ 2356.00

7. Three employees in a company are up for a special pay increase. You are given a file, say IncreaseData.txt, with the following data:

Miller Andrew 65789.87 5
Green Sheila 75892.56 6
Sethi Amit 74900.50 6.1

Each input line consists of an employee’s last name, first name, current salary, and percent pay increase. For example, in the first input line, the last name of the employee is Miller, the first name is Andrew, the current salary is 65789.87, and the pay increase is 5%. Write a program that reads data from the specified file and stores the output in the file IncreaseOutput.txt. For each employee, the data must be output in the following form: firstName lastName updatedSalary. Format the output of decimal numbers to two decimal places.
